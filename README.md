# RMIT_FSAE_Driverless
Repository for all RMIT Driverless students to share code.

Good luck to next year's students, we're sorry for the mess.

# Project
The purpose of this project is to create a driverless race car for the FSAE competition. The car needs to be able to map out it's environment and report back positions of cones which mark out the course. This information is then passed on to the Path Planning team who calculate the optimal path the vehicle shoud take and send steering and acceleration commands to the vehicle.
